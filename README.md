# Overview

This repository is about using model predictive control (MPC) and control barrier function (CBF) for robot motion planning problem with obstacle avoidance. Two methods are used: one is using eulidean distance (MPC-DC) and the other is using CBF for safety guarantee. Python and CasADi are used for implementation. It is initiated by the final project of **AEROSP 740 - Model Predictive Control (2024 Winter)** at University of Michigan - Ann Arbor.

Disclaimer: This is **NOT** an research project. Some part might not be rigorous and suggestions are welcomed.

## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/lihanlian/simple-mpc-cbf.git
```

Go to project directory
```bash
  python3 -m venv env && source env/bin/activate 
```
```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

 - run _mpc_dc_static.py_ and _mpc_dc_static_and_dynamic.py_ to generate pickle files that store robot state and control input information for MPC-DC algorithm.
 - run _mpc_cbf_static.py_ and  _mpc_cbf_static_and_dynamic.py_ to generate pickle files that store robot state and control input information for MPC-CBF algorithm. 
 - run _plot.ipynb_ to load data and visualize results.
 - Adjust hyperparameters (preidction horizon N and cbf parameter Î³) if necessary.
 - Some hyperparameters might result in bad result such as moving from one place to another instantaneously in a unreasonable way. This might be due to the nonlinearity and feasibility properties of optimization problem, and the optimization solver fail to get a good solution.
